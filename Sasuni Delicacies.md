Perfect — since Sasuni Delicacies is new to website building, the priority should be:

✅ Very easy maintenance
✅ No paid plugins / extensions
✅ Simple product catalog updates
✅ Low technical dependency
✅ Future-ready (can scale later)

Below is a clear, beginner-friendly decision guide, final tech recommendation, and exact setup path you can confidently follow.

1. What NOT to Choose (Important for Beginners)
❌ Custom Coding (React / Next.js / Laravel)

Requires developer every time

Hard to update products

Hosting + maintenance overhead

❌ Shopify

Monthly fee

Paid apps for basic features

Overkill if not doing online payments now

❌ Heavy WordPress + WooCommerce Setup

Needs paid plugins for catalog filtering, SEO, security

Frequent plugin updates break sites

Learning curve is high for non-technical founders

2. BEST OPTION (Strongly Recommended)
✅ WordPress + Elementor (Free) + Custom Post Types

This is the most beginner-friendly + zero-cost + scalable option.

Why this is perfect for Sasuni Delicacies:

Easy to update products	WordPress Admin Panel
No paid extensions	100% Free Plugins
Product catalog (not cart)	Custom Post Types
Blog & SEO	Built-in + Free SEO plugin

3. Technology Stack (Simple Explanation)
Core Setup

CMS: WordPress (Free, open-source)

Page Builder: Elementor (Free)

Domain: .com or .in

Theme: Hello Elementor (Free)

This combo is stable, fast, and beginner-safe.

4. How Product Catalog Will Work (No WooCommerce)

Instead of complex eCommerce:

👉 Use Custom Post Types (CPT)

You’ll create:

Product Name

Product Category

Description

Ingredients

Benefits

Image

Order Button (WhatsApp)

Free Plugin Needed:

Custom Post Type UI (CPT UI) – 100% free

This avoids WooCommerce completely.

if any paid plugins are not used , will they not get best SEO? Also need to track who is visiting their website and they should be communicated to these people timely so that they can reach out with a personal welcome message 


This is a very smart and practical concern, and the short answer is:

No — using only free plugins will NOT hurt SEO or visitor tracking, if it is done correctly.

Below I’ll break this down clearly, honestly, and without sales hype, so Sasuni Delicacies can decide with confidence.

1. SEO: Free vs Paid Plugins (Reality Check)
❌ Common Myth

“Paid SEO plugins give better Google ranking”

✅ Actual Truth

Google ranks websites based on:

Content quality

Page speed

Mobile friendliness

Proper structure (headings, meta tags)

User behavior (time on site)

👉 Not on whether you paid for plugins

1.1 Best Free SEO Setup (Industry-Standard)
Recommended Plugin
✅ Rank Math – Free Version

This single plugin provides:

Meta title & description

XML sitemap

Schema (structured data)

Image SEO

Redirection (basic)

404 monitoring

Social sharing metadata

Many professional agencies use Rank Math Free for client sites.

What Paid SEO Does Extra (Not Needed Initially)
Paid Feature	Is it required now?
Advanced keyword tracking	❌ No
AI content suggestions	❌ No
Advanced schema	❌ No
Rank history	❌ No

📌 For a new brand like Sasuni, content + consistency beats paid tools.

2. Will Free SEO Actually Rank Well?
Yes — if you do THESE 5 things:

Write authentic content (your story is a big advantage)

Use one main keyword per page

Optimize images (free plugin)

Make site mobile-fast

Publish blogs monthly

Many food brands rank using only free SEO tools.

3. Visitor Tracking (100% Free & Powerful)
✅ Use Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

Cost: Free
Accuracy: Industry standard
Data you get:

Who visited

Location (city-level)

Pages viewed

Time spent

Device used

Returning visitors

Setup (Simple)

Install Google Site Kit (free)

Done in 10 minutes

4. Knowing WHO Visited (Personal Reality Check)
Important Truth

Due to privacy laws, you cannot see names/emails unless visitors voluntarily give them.

So:

❌ No automatic personal identity

✅ Yes to behavior & intent signals

5. How to Personally Communicate With Visitors (Best Free Strategy)

Instead of invasive tracking, use intent-based engagement.

5.1 Personal Welcome Message (Ethical & Effective)
Option A: WhatsApp Chat (Highly Recommended)

Use a Free WhatsApp Chat Plugin:

Trigger after 20–30 seconds

Message example:

Hi 👋 Welcome to Sasuni Delicacies!
Looking for gluten-free baking or traditional health powders?
We’re happy to help 😊

✔️ Feels personal
✔️ High conversion
✔️ No privacy issues

5.2 Email Capture (Optional, Free)
Use WPForms Lite

Add:

“Get a free healthy recipe PDF”

“First order discount”

Now you can:

Email them personally

Send product updates

📌 Email tools:

Mailchimp Free (up to 500 contacts)

Brevo (Sendinblue) Free

6. Advanced Visitor Intent Tracking (Still Free)
Use Google Analytics Events

Track:

Product page views

WhatsApp click

Contact form submit

This tells you:

“This visitor is interested in gluten-free baking”

You can then:

Change homepage message

Follow up on WhatsApp if they contact

7. What Paid Tools Would Give (Later, Not Now)
Tool Type	When Needed
Heatmaps (Hotjar)	After 5k+ visitors/month
CRM automation	After consistent leads
Advanced SEO	After 6–9 months

👉 Not needed for launch

8. Final Honest Recommendation
For Sasuni Delicacies (Year 1)

✅ Free SEO plugins are more than sufficient
